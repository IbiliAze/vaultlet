# vaultlet — outstanding work

Baseline status as of 2026-09-01 (`89b0bdc`); §1.4 and related logging/test
notes updated 2026-09-05 against the working tree. `GetSecret`,
`ListSecrets` and `DeleteSecret` are implemented and verified end to end against
Bitwarden; `PutSecret` is implemented but untested against a write-enabled token.

Ordered roughly by impact. The suggested sequence is at the bottom.

## 1. Functional gaps

### 1.1 WatchSecrets works end to end, not yet hardened

- [ ] In progress. Status as of 2026-09-09 (`1e1245e` plus uncommitted
      changes). Port, domain event, Bitwarden poller with retry on failed
      polls and context-aware sends, `Service.Watch` with policy and audit,
      poll interval floor, and the streaming gRPC handler are all in place.
      `go test ./...` passes. Not yet verified against a live server.

Design as built: `Watch` sits directly on `ports.SecretStore`, not behind an
optional `ports.Watcher` with a polling decorator as the README says. Every
backend must therefore implement `Watch`, and the poll loop lives in the
Bitwarden adapter. Accept that and fix the README, or extract the loop into
`internal/adapters/driven/watch` before the AWS backend needs it.

Policy as built: `canWatch` requires both `list` and `watch` on an
overlapping namespace. Deliberate, but undocumented; add a comment on
`canWatch` and a line in the README's policy section.

Remaining:

- [ ] **`IN_SYNC` wire shape** (`handlers.go`). It is sent with a non-nil
      `Meta` carrying an empty key, empty version and zero `created_at`. The
      proto says meta is unset for `IN_SYNC` and the CLI keys on
      `GetMeta() == nil`, so it currently prints `IN_SYNC` and two blanks.
      Send `Meta: nil` when `ev.Type == domain.InSync`.
- [ ] **Client disconnect is reported as `Internal`.** When the client goes
      away, `Send` fails and the handler returns `codes.Internal`, so the
      logging interceptor records an error for every normal disconnect.
      Return `nil` when `ctx.Err() != nil`, the error otherwise.
- [ ] **Event filtering.** `Service.Watch` checks the namespace once and
      forwards every event. A subscriber to an ancestor namespace sees keys
      it may not `List`. Wrap the channel in a goroutine that drops events
      whose key falls outside a permitted rule, mirroring `List`.
- [ ] **Test fake.** `fakeStore.Watch` now returns
      `make(<-chan domain.SecretEvent)`, an open channel nothing will ever
      write to or close, so ranging over it still blocks forever. Make a
      bidirectional channel, `close` it, and return it.
- [ ] **Tests.** None for Watch yet. Poller against a fake `List`: snapshot
      then `InSync`, each diff case, cancellation closes the channel, failed
      poll emits nothing and does not close. Service: denied subscribe never
      reaches the store, ancestor filtering, one audit record. Handler:
      `mapEvent`, nil meta on `IN_SYNC`, `PERMISSION_DENIED`, cancellation
      returns `nil`.
- [ ] **Verify live** against Bitwarden: subscribe, edit a secret in the UI,
      confirm `UPDATED` within one poll interval, `vaultlet get` returns the
      new value, Ctrl-C ends the stream without a server-side error log.
- [ ] **Docs and tidy.** Reconcile the README's Watch section with the design
      kept; drop the §1.4 note that watch policy/audit belongs here; rename
      `domain.Type` to `EventType`; replace `switch exists { case false /
      case true }` with `if`/`else`. In the poller, the bare `ctx.Done()`
      before the snapshot `return` is a no-op, and the trailing
      `if err != nil` block at the end of the tick is unreachable since the
      error now hits `continue` first; delete both.

### 1.2 Compare-and-swap

- [x] `DeleteSecret` now rejects `expected_version` with `Unimplemented`,
      matching `PutSecret` (`ad85107`). The two RPCs are consistent and no
      longer mislead callers.
- [ ] Real compare-and-swap is still unimplemented.

Real CAS needs an `expectedVersion` parameter on `SecretStore.Put` and
`.Delete`, plus `ports.ErrVersionMismatch` mapped to `ABORTED`. Bitwarden has no
native CAS, so it would be a read-compare-write with a race window — which is
worth saying out loud in the adapter rather than pretending otherwise. Until
then `--expected-version` on the CLI is a flag that can only ever fail; consider
hiding it.

### 1.3 No TLS on the server

- [x] Done (`89b0bdc`). `config.TLSConfig` (`tls.cert_file` / `tls.key_file`
      in `vaultlet.yaml`) feeds `grpcserver.New(store, cfg.TLS)`, which builds
      the server with `grpc.Creds(...)` via `credentials.NewServerTLSFromFile`.
      TLS is mandatory — there is no plaintext mode — and `Validate()` rejects
      missing cert/key paths with clear messages before startup.
- [x] Verified live: booted with the self-signed dev cert in `cert/`
      (gitignored), `openssl s_client -CAfile cert/cert.pem` handshakes
      TLSv1.3 with verify code 0, and SIGTERM still drains cleanly through
      the new code path.

- [x] The TLS 1.3 floor nit is resolved (uncommitted): `New` now uses
      `tls.LoadX509KeyPair` + `credentials.NewTLS(&tls.Config{MinVersion:
      tls.VersionTLS13})`, matching the client's pin. Verified live: openssl
      handshakes at 1.3 with verify code 0, and a forced `-tls1_2` client is
      rejected with a protocol-version alert. The explicit `tls.Config` is
      also where `ClientCAs`/`ClientAuth` would go if mTLS is ever wanted.

Nothing remains; §1.3 is complete.

### 1.4 Authentication, authorization and audit

- [x] Authentication implemented. The CLI sends `--token` /
      `$VAULTLET_TOKEN` — base64("user:password") — as `authorization: Basic`
      per-RPC credentials (`tokenCreds` refuses plaintext transport). The
      server verifies it in unary + stream interceptors (`grpcserver/auth.go`)
      against bcrypt hashes in `auth.users`, answering every failure mode with
      the same `UNAUTHENTICATED "invalid credentials"` (unknown users burn a
      dummy bcrypt compare so timing matches). The principal lands in the
      context via `app.WithPrincipal`. Verified live: no token, wrong
      password, and malformed token all rejected; valid token lists secrets.
- [x] Authorization implemented. Startup compiles per-user `allow` rules
      (namespace + actions) into an `app.Policy` and passes an `app.Service`
      wrapper to gRPC. Checks deny by default using `Namespace.Contains`;
      all four handlers map `app.ErrPermissionDenied` to `PERMISSION_DENIED`.
- [x] List filtering implemented. `canList` permits requests overlapping a
      namespace the principal may list, including ancestor and empty-namespace
      requests. Each result must be within both the requested namespace and
      a rule granting `list`. Requests with no permitted overlap skip the
      backend and return permission denied.
- [x] Application audit implemented. Get, Put, List and Delete emit one record
      per normal return path with principal, action, key (namespace for List),
      decision and outcome. Records contain no values, credentials or raw
      backend errors. The default server logger writes JSON to stderr.
- [x] RPC logging implemented in unary and stream interceptors, registered
      before authentication so rejected credentials are logged too. Records
      include method, duration in milliseconds and returned gRPC status;
      streaming duration covers the handler's lifetime. This absorbs §2.5.
- [ ] Behavioral verification remains: allowed and denied operations, denied
      calls skipping the backend, List filtering for ancestor/empty namespaces
      and segment boundaries, backend failures, one audit record per service
      call, and RPC completion logging for success/authentication/policy errors.

Implementation is complete for the current Get/Put/List/Delete surface.
`go test ./...` passes, but there are no tests yet; this confirms compilation,
not runtime authorization or audit behavior. Authentication's earlier live
verification is recorded above. Watch policy/audit belongs with §1.1 when that
RPC is implemented.

### 1.5 Read-only backends (`ports.ErrReadOnly`)

- [x] Done (`02eac5a`). `ports.ErrReadOnly` is declared alongside `ErrNotFound`
      and wrapped by the adapter as `fmt.Errorf("bitwarden: %w", ...)`, so
      `errors.Is` works across the port boundary.
- [x] `bitwarden.Config.AllowWrites` (`allow_writes` in `vaultlet.yaml`) gates
      both writes: `Put` and `Delete` return `ErrReadOnly`, `Get` and `List`
      are unaffected.
- [x] `PutSecret` and `DeleteSecret` map it to `FAILED_PRECONDITION` with a
      fixed "backend is read-only" message, ahead of the `ErrNotFound` and
      `ErrEmptyValue` branches so it cannot be shadowed. The backend name is not
      leaked to clients, per the proto's design note.

Open question, not a defect: `vaultlet.yaml` ships `allow_writes: true`, so the
zero value is permissive. Deny-by-default would fail safe for a service the
proto describes as "read-mostly". Worth deciding deliberately.

## 2. Bugs

### 2.1 `make build` does not stamp the version

- [x] Fixed. `CLI_PKG` now points at `internal/adapters/driving/cli`
      (`3f73bf3`); `make build && ./bin/vaultlet-cli version` reports
      `vaultlet 6b8fd65 (commit 6b8fd65, built 2026-08-31T19:03:52Z)`.
      The `root.go` doc comment was corrected too.
- [x] The last stale path in `cmd/vaultlet-cli/main.go:3` was corrected
      (`49c8a54`). No `internal/adapters/cli` references remain.

### 2.2 `config.Load` discards both load errors

- [x] Fixed (`6b8fd65`). Both `k.Load` calls are now checked, with
      `errors.Is(err, fs.ErrNotExist)` tolerating a missing `vaultlet.yaml` or
      `.env`, and the env-provider error propagated.
- [x] `Config.Validate()` was added and is called from `cmd/vaultlet/main.go`
      before the backend is opened. It covers `Backend` and `Listen`.

### 2.3 The server cannot shut down cleanly

- [x] `server.go` moved off `log` onto `slog`.
- [x] Graceful shutdown implemented (`d096586`). `run()` builds a
      signal-aware context via `signal.NotifyContext` (SIGINT/SIGTERM);
      `Listen` runs `Serve` in a goroutine and selects on `ctx.Done()`, then
      drains via `GracefulStop` bounded by a 10s `shutdownTimeout` with a
      forced `Stop()` fallback.
- [x] The nil-listener regression is fixed in the same change: `Listen`
      returns an `error` for both `net.Listen` and `Serve` failures, and
      `run()` propagates it.
- [x] Bonus fix found along the way: the `store.(interface{ Close() error })`
      assertion in `main.go` never matched the Bitwarden store's `Close()`
      (no error return), so the FFI handle leaked on every exit. Now asserts
      `interface{ Close() }`.

### 2.4 `domain.Namespace.Matches` is an unfinished stub

- [x] Resolved (`6b8fd65`) by dropping the dangling comment. `key.go` now ends
      cleanly at `Contains`. Glob matching remains unimplemented, which is fine
      — nothing depends on it.

### 2.5 Per-RPC invocation logging

- [x] The copy-paste slip introduced in `e5d8406` is fixed (`49c8a54`): each
      handler now names its own RPC rather than all four claiming `GetSecret`.
- [x] Unary and stream logging interceptors now use `slog.InfoContext` to
      record method, duration and returned status, including authentication
      failures. The four bare "invoked" lines are removed; handler error logs
      remain. Key/namespace and principal details live in the application
      audit records described in §1.4.

Implementation complete; behavioral verification is tracked in §1.4.

---

## 3. Missing scaffolding

### 3.1 No tests

- [ ] Not started. Still no `_test.go` anywhere in the repo, though `make test`
      exists.

- `domain`: `ParseKey`, `ParseNamespace`, `Namespace.Contains` are pure
  functions against a documented grammar. Cheapest, highest-value tests here.
- `app`: policy enforcement, filtered listings and audit records, including
  denied calls never reaching the backend (see §1.4).
- `grpcserver`: the handlers are testable against a fake `ports.SecretStore` —
  particularly the error mapping (`ErrNotFound` → `NOT_FOUND`, `ErrEmptyValue` →
  `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, empty namespace → list everything, non-empty page token →
  rejected, `expected_version` → `UNIMPLEMENTED` on both put and delete).
  Also cover `ErrPermissionDenied` → `PERMISSION_DENIED` and interceptor
  completion records for successful calls and authentication/policy failures.
- `cli`: `NewRootCmd` returns a `*cobra.Command` specifically so "tests can
  execute commands with their own args and output buffers" — a seam nothing
  currently uses.

### 3.2 Pagination is server-side unimplemented

- [ ] Not started.

`ListSecrets` ignores `page_size` and always returns one page. This is legal per
the proto ("server may return fewer than requested") and the CLI already loops
on `next_page_token`, so it can wait — but it will matter on a large org.

### 3.3 Second backend

- [ ] Not started.

`internal/adapters/driven/aws/` is an empty directory. A second backend is the
whole point of the ports design and the best proof the abstraction holds.

---

## 4. Smaller items

- [ ] `list.go` uses `cobra.ExactArgs(1)`, so the CLI cannot reach the
      empty-namespace "list everything" the server now supports.
      `cobra.MaximumNArgs(1)` opens it up.
- [ ] `resolveID` lists the entire organization on every Get, Put and Delete.
      The comment acknowledges the cost; it will bite once the vault is
      non-trivial. A short-lived name→UUID cache is the obvious mitigation.
- [ ] A permissions gap and a genuinely absent secret are indistinguishable to
      the caller — both surface as `NOT_FOUND`. An org listing that returns zero
      rows overall is far more likely to be a misconfigured machine account than
      an empty vault, and is worth logging as such in `resolveID`. (Confirmed in
      practice: a machine account with no project access reads as an empty org.)
- [x] `ListSecretsResponse{..., NextPageToken: ""}` — the explicit zero value
      was dropped (`49c8a54`).
- [x] Stray blank lines before a closing brace in the read-only guards
      (`handlers.go` `DeleteSecret`, `bitwarden.go` `Delete`) — removed
      (uncommitted). All three sites are now clean.

---

## Suggested order

1. Domain, app and handler/interceptor tests, including the authorization and
   audit verification in §1.4.
2. Harden `WatchSecrets` per §1.1 and verify it live.
